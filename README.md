# aws-transfers-sftp-quickstart

AWS Transfers for SFTP is a fully managed service that allows to easily upload/download data to/from AWS S3 using the SFTP protocol. In the previous blog post, we created a managed SFTP endpoint using the public key authentication. Sometimes, a username/password authentication may be required, e.g. if the access should be provided to existing users, e.g. from the AWS Cognito User Pool. 

This is a repository with a quickstart created as a part of our blog post: https://agilevision.io/blog/aws/2019/02/06/integrate-aws-sftp-with-custom-identity-provider.html
